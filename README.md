A neat way how to combine **Emacs/Atom/Sublime editor + Markdown Syntax + Git + Html engine** (bootstrap/python) to get the best notes-talking experience ever. Highly customizable with plugins written in Python. What's the most important, under the hood it's just a set of Markdown files.. you can do with them whatever you want, e.g. you can Pandoc (http://pandoc.org/epub.html) them to epub (that's origin of "book" part of the name).

Motto: **Notes are like your code**.

**The preview of the default template:**

Similar projects: it's kind of like Sphinx for your documentation, or Mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/).

Freatures:

- Index html based
- Sync them with Dropbox/iCloud/github
- Read from console, grep them
- Edit with almost any text editor, I'm using Emacs!
- Keep images separately, edit them in any external tool or edit them in batch
- Customize html templates
- You can sync notes in your system with notes kept at virtual machines (mounted via sshfs) or drives
- Super light!
- Pandoc markdown files to anything you want!
- Use 3rd party editors, if you wish, on your computer or on your phone.

I recommend to use **Emacs** (or VIM or other super-powerfull editor) to:

- run git on your notes in your editor,
- grep them in the editor,
- make bookmarks to parts of your notes,
- copy-paste from your notes to your programs you're writing,
- use Google Translate (https://github.com/atykhonov/google-translate)
- ispell,
- outline mode,
- focuse mode.

Sync with **Github** to have your notes (full-text searchable) with you all the time (in a private repository):
